## About All projects:
Each project is organized in a separate file with a specific name.
Projects are either for training or a classroom project.
All my semester projects are going to be here.
By downloading the project and opening it, you will be asked which project do you want? And you can enter there by hitting the project number.
Then see the project.
This project works with Vite, just open the **Terminal** and then enter the code:
`npm run dev`
This will make you a location that you can open the project by clicking on.

I have been working seriously for a few months.
And I believe that science must be experienced, coding should be so coded until it is learned.
Hope you follow most of my work in the future.
